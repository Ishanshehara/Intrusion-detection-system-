 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Project

This repository contains a small intrusion detection system (IDS) prototype used for coursework and testing. It includes a GUI, a terminal interface, an attack simulator, logging, and a small alerts database.

Files of interest
- `ids_gui.py` - Graphical user interface for the IDS.
- `ids_terminal.py` - Terminal-based interface for monitoring and interacting with the IDS.
- `attack_simulator.py` - Script to simulate attacks against the IDS for testing and demonstrations.
- `alerts.log` - Plain-text log of alerts (auto-generated by the project during runs).
- `ids_alerts.db` - SQLite database used to persist alert records.
- `Complete IDS Project Report.pdf` - Project report and documentation (PDF).
- `Sistema de Detección de Intrusiones.png` - Project diagram / image asset.

Quick start (Windows / PowerShell)

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install dependencies (if any). This project is mostly plain Python but if your code requires packages, install them with pip. Example:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the GUI:

```powershell
python ids_gui.py
```

4. Run the attack simulator to generate test traffic:

```powershell
python attack_simulator.py
```

Notes
- This README assumes Python 3.8+ is available on your PATH.
- The repository currently stores a small SQLite DB (`ids_alerts.db`) and `alerts.log` in the project folder. If you don't want these tracked in Git, consider adding them to `.gitignore`.
- If you need help running or testing a specific component (GUI, terminal UI, simulator), open an issue or message me with the specific file name and desired behavior.
